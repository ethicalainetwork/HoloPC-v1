<h2 align="center">üöÄ Getting Started</h2>

You can experience HoloPC in several ways: by visiting the hosted website, by running it using Docker for simplicity, or by building the source code yourself for local development and greater control.

### Hosted Version

For the quickest way to try HoloPC, access the live, hosted version at:
[https://holopc.nla.la](https://holopc.nla.la)

### Using Docker (Recommended for Quick Setup)

The easiest way to get HoloPC up and running is by using Docker. This method encapsulates all dependencies and services within containers, simplifying the setup process.

1.  **Ensure Docker is Installed:** Make sure you have Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine and Docker Compose) installed on your system. You can download it from [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ethicalainetwork/HoloPC-v1.git](https://github.com/ethicalainetwork/HoloPC-v1.git)
    cd HoloPC-v1
    ```

3.  **Launch the Project:**
    From the project's root directory, execute:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    This command will build (if necessary) and start all required services in the background.

4.  **Access HoloPC:**
    Once the containers are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

### Building from Source (For Local Development Without Docker)

If you prefer to run HoloPC without Docker, you'll need to install the dependencies and manage the services manually.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

* **Git:** Essential for cloning the project repository.
* **Node.js (v16+ recommended):** Includes `npm` (Node Package Manager), which is used to manage the Angular frontend and Express.js server dependencies. Download from [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
* **Python 3 (v3.8+ recommended):** Required for the Whisper streaming backend.

#### Installation and Build Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ethicalainetwork/HoloPC-v1.git](https://github.com/ethicalainetwork/HoloPC-v1.git)
    cd HoloPC-v1
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies and Build Frontend:**
    From the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the `server/` directory, create and activate a Python virtual environment, then install the necessary Python libraries:
    ```bash
    cd server/
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install librosa soundfile faster-whisper websockets
    deactivate # Deactivate the virtual environment
    cd .. # Go back to the project root
    ```
    *Note: `faster-whisper` is the recommended backend for superior performance. If you plan to utilize GPU acceleration, please consult the `faster-whisper` documentation for specific NVIDIA driver and library requirements (e.g., CUDNN 8.5.0, CUDA 11.7).*

4. **(Optional) Configure Whisper Backend (Non-Docker):**
    The project is set up to use `faster-whisper` by default. If you need to switch to an alternative backend:
    * **`whisper-timestamped` (alternative, but slower):**
        ```bash
        pip install git+[https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped](https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped)
        ```
    * **OpenAI API (requires an API key and incurs costs):**
        ```bash
        pip install openai
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_api_key # Replace with your secret API key
        ```
        *When using the OpenAI API backend, be mindful of your usage and potential costs, as audio fragments are processed multiple times. Setting a higher `chunk-size` can help reduce expenses.*

#### Running in Development Mode (Non-Docker)

After installing all dependencies as described above, you can launch HoloPC using the provided script:

1.  **Start all services:**
    From the project's root directory, execute:
    ```bash
    sh newfullrun.sh
    ```
    This script will launch the Angular frontend, Express.js server, and the Python Whisper backend, each within its own `screen` session.

2.  **Verify and manage running services:**
    To see a list of active `screen` sessions:
    ```bash
    screen -ls
    ```
    To attach to a specific service's console (e.g., for logs or debugging):
    ```bash
    screen -r fe      # Attach to the Angular frontend session
    screen -r whisper # Attach to the Whisper Python backend session
    screen -r js      # Attach to the Express.js server session
    ```
    *To detach from a `screen` session without stopping it, press `Ctrl+A`, then `D`.*

3.  **Access HoloPC:**
    Once all services are up and running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    * **Frontend (Angular):** `http://localhost:4200`
    * **Web Application (for audio input):** `http://localhost:3333` (or `http://localhost:4200` depending on your specific configuration)

#### Manual Service Startup (Advanced Users/Debugging - Non-Docker)

If you prefer granular control or need to debug individual components, you can start each service manually:

* **Angular Frontend:**
    Navigate to the project's root and run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This typically serves the frontend on `http://localhost:4200`.

* **Express.js Server:**
    Navigate to the `server` directory and run:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    This server typically listens on `http://localhost:3000`.

* **Whisper Streaming Backend (Python):**
    Navigate to the project's root. Ensure your Python virtual environment is activated, then run:
    ```bash
    cd server/
    source venv/bin/activate # Activate venv
    python3 whisper_streaming/optimized_streaming_simple.py --model tiny.en
    # When done: deactivate
    cd ..
    ```
    This backend typically listens on `http://localhost:8765`.
    *You can specify a different Whisper model (e.g., `--model medium.en`) based on your system's available VRAM and desired accuracy. Refer to the "Whisper Model Sizes and Performance" table below.*

<h2 align="center">‚öôÔ∏è Whisper Model Sizes and Performance</h2>

The choice of Whisper model for the speech-to-text backend significantly impacts both the required VRAM (Video RAM) and processing speed. Select a model that best suits your hardware capabilities and performance needs:

| Size   | Parameters | English-only Model | Multilingual Model | Required VRAM | Relative Speed |
| :----- | :--------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :------------ | :------------- |
| `tiny` | 39 M       | `tiny.en`          | `tiny`             | ~1 GB         | ~10x           |
| `base` | 74 M       | `base.en`          | `base`             | ~1 GB         | ~7x            |
| `small`| 244 M      | `small.en`         | `small`            | ~2 GB         | ~4x            |
| `medium`| 769 M     | `medium.en`        | `medium`           | ~5 GB         | ~2x            |
| `large`| 1550 M     | N/A                | `large`            | ~10 GB        | 1x             |
| `turbo`| 809 M      | N/A                | `turbo`            | ~6 GB         | ~8x            |

*(Note: The `turbo` model is a `faster-whisper` specific optimization, generally providing a good balance of size and speed.)*

<h2 align="center">üß± Building the Mirror</h2>

To create the holographic projection effect using HoloPC, you‚Äôll need a simple yet precise physical structure made of 4 trapezoidal pieces of acrylic glass. This forms a reflective pyramid that sits on your device‚Äôs screen and reflects the rendered images to appear as floating holograms in mid-air.

<br>

### üìê What You Need:
- Material: Clear acrylic glass (also known as plexiglass or PMMA), 2‚Äì3mm thick
- Quantity: 4 identical isosceles trapezoids


### üìè Recommended Dimensions (per trapezoid):

|Top Width  |   Bottom Width |    Height |   Angle |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| 1.5 cm    |  6 cm          |    3.5 cm |   ~45¬∞  |


‚ö†Ô∏è Dimensions can be scaled depending on your device and desired hologram size. Larger screens may need larger trapezoids‚Äîjust keep all four identical.

---
<h2 align="center">üß∞ üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Steps</h2>

    
1. **Cut the Acrylic**\
Use a precision laser cutter or fine saw to cut 4 identical trapezoidal shapes from your acrylic sheet.
    
2. **Clean the Surfaces**\
Remove any protective film and wipe the acrylic clean with a soft cloth to ensure maximum clarity.
    
3. **Form the Pyramid**\
Arrange the 4 pieces with their smaller edges facing upward, joining the slanted sides together to form a pyramid with an open top and bottom.
    
4. **Bond the Edges**\
Use clear acrylic glue or transparent double-sided tape to carefully bond the sides together. Ensure the angles are symmetrical and all joints are clean.
    
5. **Place on Screen**\
Invert the pyramid (small edge on top) and place it centered on your device screen where HoloPC is running. The projection will now reflect from all four sides, creating a floating image above the base.

<br />

<br/>

**üîß Tips for Best Results:**
- Use a dark background in your environment to enhance the floating effect.
- Angle accuracy is crucial ‚Äî all sides must match for the illusion to align.
- You can also 3D print a base to hold the mirror stable, especially for mobile setups.
